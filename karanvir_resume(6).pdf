E-commerce Software Developer June 2024 – Present
IPPINKA Toronto, ON
– Lead developer at a curated e-commerce brand with 5,000+ Amazon listings, bridging independent designers and
global buyers
– Designed and maintained backend infrastructure using Node.js, TypeScript, and Google Apps Script to automate
listings, POs, inventory, and reporting
– Built a metadata-aware caching system for Google Sheets, reducing API load and improving latency across
distributed automation flows
– Developed automated pipelines for FBA prep, Flodesk email marketing integration, and cross-sheet data
synchronization
– Launched a demand forecasting pipeline using 10+ years of sales data; incorporated seasonality, holidays, and
behavioral heuristics
– Managed a MongoDB database of historical sales and shipment records to support forecasting, PO generation, and
product tracking
– Led full-stack automation of the PO system:
∗ Engineered nonlinear MINLP solver logic using Pyomo, SCIP, and CPLEX to model MOQ, bundling, and
ratio constraints
∗ Built resilient backend with exponential backoff and solver orchestration via Conda and Node.js subprocesses


--- PAGE 1 ---

∗ Scheduled automated daily PO generation to forecast and initiate orders with minimal manual oversight
∗ Developed a distribution handler to detect and reallocate inventory when incorrect listings or quantities were
ordered
∗ Created supplier-facing web tools for box tracking and automated invoice upload
– Optimized post-arrival bundling with a CPLEX-based reallocation model to reduce variance between projected and
real-time demand
– Automated Amazon Box Content uploads and engineered kitting workflows to streamline bundle fulfillment
– Integrated Rainforest API to monitor product reviews and flag listings based on velocity and sentiment trends
– Hardened internal tools with CAPTCHA and other access control measures to mitigate bot threats
– Spearheaded hiring for 3 developers (junior, mid-level, senior); led onboarding with personalized documentation
and technical mentorship
– Maintained critical backend services and authored internal dev documentation covering logic, deployment, and
workflows
– Migrated project management from Pivotal Tracker to Jira, including schema translation and team-wide training
– Deployed and monitored services on DigitalOcean using NGINX, custom dashboards, and internal performance
